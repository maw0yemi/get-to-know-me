<h5>Job description</h5>
<p>The small and friendly Events Team recruited me as a Student Event Helper to assist with the busy and exciting schedule of events planned throughout the year. Offer Holder Days, Open Days, the Abertay Digital Graduate Show, Graduation, and conferences were just a few of the events that I covered! There are various aspects to delivering a successful event - from setup to end result - and my input was valuable. When delivering events on campus, I was involved in a range of activities – from helping with signage around the University, preparing goody bags, badges, registration desks, welcoming and directing guests, answering queries, or finding the right person to answer the query, in general being on hand and ready to help. Student Event Helpers also assisted with delivering a wide range of online events.</p>

			<p><strong>Events Worked In: </strong>Open days, Offer holder days, EYEE conference, Graduation, Abertay Digital Graduate Show, CyberQuarter Events, High School visits, Campus tours, Freshers week, Prizegiving, Student term registration, International welcome & workshops, BBC Dundee radio festival.</p>
