	    <h5>Description</h5>
		<p >This module is designed to provide all BMS students, on both Applied and Standard programme routes, with [a] an understanding of information relevant to professional work in the clinical environment, and [b] an understanding of bioethics (medical ethics). The module covers essential aspects of the profession that are mandatory for all students on both programme routes, in order to meet IBMS accreditation requirements. the module is an essential pre-requisite for students undertaking subsequent hospital placements on the Applied route, in order to meet HCPC approval requirements.</p>

		<h5>Aims</h5>
		<p >The aim of this Module is to provide the student with an understanding of career structure, professional codes and good laboratory management in Health Service Biomedical Science and other bioscience industries; and [b] provide reflective education in bioethics.</p>
	
        <h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
				<p>By the end of this module I was able to:</p>

		<ol>
					<li>Discuss and explain the professional scope of practice and conduct in Biomedical Science and other Bioscience Industries and outline the functional roles of the IBMS and HCPC.</li>
					<li>Evaluate relevant Health & Safety legislation and its appropriate implementation for Bioscience employees.</li>
					<li>Discuss and explain the importance of specimen integrity on receipt into the laboratory.</li>
					<li>Discuss and explain clinical governance and accreditation in laboratories.</li>
					<li>Evaluate the ethical issues arising from developments in medicine and biology.</li>
					
		</ol>
