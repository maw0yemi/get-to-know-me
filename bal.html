				<h3>Basketball Experience</h3>
			</div>
    <div class="main-container">
<p>My basketball journey has been a rewarding experience, starting as a player on several local teams, including an affiliate team of Marc Gasol’s professional team in our hometown of Girona. It was an amazing opportunity to play alongside talented players, and it gave me a chance to grow and develop my skills in a supportive environment.</p>

<p>Throughout my time playing, I also participated in a few international tournaments as an amateur player and as part of the U18 team. These tournaments were a great way for me to experience different playing styles and learn from players around the world. It was exciting to compete internationally, and it helped me improve my game, even if it wasn’t at the highest professional level.</p>

<p>In addition to playing, I spent many years as a referee, including officiating at some local finals. While the stakes weren’t high, it gave me a unique perspective on the game and taught me how to stay focused, fair, and impartial. Refereeing also helped me improve my decision-making skills and my ability to manage situations quickly and calmly.</p>

<p>As the president of the university's basketball club, I took on a leadership role where I organized practices, coordinated team activities, and worked to create a welcoming atmosphere for everyone. It was a lot of responsibility, but it taught me important skills like organization, communication, and teamwork. I also learned how to motivate others and foster a sense of community within the team.</p>

<p>Through all these experiences—playing, refereeing, and leading—I’ve built a strong connection to basketball. It’s more than just a sport; it’s a community where teamwork, respect, and hard work are key. The lessons I’ve learned along the way, from collaborating with teammates to managing challenges and building relationships, have shaped who I am both on and off the court.</p>
>Each role I've undertaken has developed a diverse skill set, including leadership, communication, critical thinking, and resilience. Whether on the court as a player, off the court as a referee, or in a leadership role as president, basketball has shaped me into a versatile individual who understands the power of teamwork, leadership, and community both within the sport and beyond.</p>
