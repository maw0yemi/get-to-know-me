				<h3>Basketball Experience</h3>
			</div>
    <div class="main-container">


<p>My basketball journey has been an incredible experience, one that has shaped me both on and off the court. I had the honor of playing for the affiliate team of Mark Gasol’s NBA and World Championship team in Girona, our shared hometown. This experience provided me with the opportunity to compete at a high level, where I learned valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and strategy, while also fostering a deep sense of connection to my community.</p>
	<p>Throughout my career, I participated in several international tournaments, which allowed me to showcase my skills on a global stage and learn from a diverse array of players and coaching styles. Playing in these tournaments enhanced my ability to adapt to different styles of play and think critically in high-pressure situations. These international experiences not only helped me grow as a player but also gave me a broader perspective on the global basketball community.</p>	
    <p>In addition to playing, I also served as a long-time referee, where I had the opportunity to officiate high-stakes finals. Refereeing at this level taught me the importance of impartiality, focus, and maintaining control in high-pressure environments. My experience as a referee gave me a unique understanding of the game, as I was tasked with ensuring fairness and upholding the integrity of every match.</p>
    <p>As president of the university's basketball club team, I was able to merge my playing, refereeing, and leadership experiences. I took on the responsibility of overseeing the team, organizing practices, managing resources, and fostering a positive and supportive environment. This role sharpened my leadership and organizational skills and taught me how to manage a team effectively while maintaining a strong sense of community and belonging.</p>
    <p>The connection to the sport and the people within the basketball community has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my experience. Through playing for Mark Gasol’s affiliate team, representing Girona in international tournaments, officiating finals, and leading the university club, I’ve gained a deep sense of purpose and pride. These experiences have not only made me a better player and leader but also reinforced the importance of collaboration, respect, and shared goals.</p>
    <p>Each role I've undertaken has developed a diverse skill set, including leadership, communication, critical thinking, and resilience. Whether on the court as a player, off the court as a referee, or in a leadership role as president, basketball has shaped me into a versatile individual who understands the power of teamwork, leadership, and community both within the sport and beyond.</p>
