				<h3>Basketball Experience</h3>
			</div>
    <div class="main-container">


<p> I have been playing basketball since I was a kid. My dad, who loves basketball and used to play and coach at a semi-professional level, introduced me to the sport. I joined my first team with my older sister in primary school, and since then, I’ve played on four different teams. At the Ubv Villalba Basketball Club, I was a co-captain in the alevin category (12-13 years old). Because we were so young, my role was mainly about building good relationships within the team and creating a positive atmosphere. My basketball team has always been a big part of my life, giving me a chance to do something healthy and fun with amazing people who became like family.</p>
		<p>When I moved to Scotland, I joined the university team and became the captain at the start of my third year. This honor allowed me to take on more responsibilities within the team, blending leadership, communication, organization, planning, and interpersonal skills. My role involved developing strategies, making decisions, helping players improve, and solving conflicts, all of which required high emotional intelligence. At the end of my last season, I received a Colours award, which is given to those who perform exceptionally well in their sport.</p>
		<p>Being part of the basketball community helped me create a network of friends and mentors, giving me a sense of belonging during tough times. It taught me the importance of teamwork and collaboration, working together towards a common goal, and supporting each other on and off the court. Interacting with teammates, coaches, and opponents improved my social skills, such as empathy, respect, and the ability to work with different groups of people. Balancing school, practice, games, and other activities taught me discipline and time management, helping me prioritize tasks and manage my time well. In conclusion, being part of the basketball community has empowered me by providing valuable life skills, a sense of purpose, and a supportive environment that has contributed to my overall growth and well-being. 100% recommended!!</p>
